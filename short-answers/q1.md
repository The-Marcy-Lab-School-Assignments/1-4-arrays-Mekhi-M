# Question

Look at the following code:

```js
let name = "mike";
const changeName = (nameToChange) => {
  nameToChange = "tom";
};
changeName(name);
console.log(name);

const favoriteLocations = ["New York City", "Jersey City"];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  locations.unshift("Boston");
};
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Why was `favoriteLocations` changed, but `name` was not?

# Answer

Strings and all other primitive data types pass by value, while arrays and other reference data types pass by reference. This means that when name was passed into changeName, the parameter copied what name evaluated to. When the nameToChange parameter was changed, its value was changed but the original name variable was unaffected.

On the other hand, when favoriteLocations was passed into addBostonToFavorites, the parameter copied what favoriteLocations was referencing. When the locations parameter was changed in the function, it changed the data it was referencing. Since favoriteLocations references this data later on in the code, it will evaluate to this changed data.
