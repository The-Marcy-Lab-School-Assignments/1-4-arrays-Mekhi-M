# Question

Look at the following code:

```js
const favoriteLocations = ["New York City", "Jersey City"];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  locations.unshift("Boston");
};
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Is `addBostonToFavorites` a pure function? Why or why not?

# Answer

It is not. The unshift() method mutates an array. Since the favoriteLocations variable and the locations parameter are both pointing to the same array changes made to locations within the function will affect favoriteLocation even though it is outside of the function.
